Question: Who started the Bethel branch of the religion the black community founded in the former US capital?
Passage 1: Platinum Airport is a state-owned public-use airport located in Platinum, in the Bethel Census Area of the U.S. state of Alaska.
Passage 2: The church was organized by African - American members of St. George's Methodist Church who walked out due to racial segregation in the worship services. Mother Bethel was one of the first African - American churches in the United States, dedicated July 29, 1794, by Bishop Francis Asbury. On October 12, 1794, Reverend Robert Blackwell announced that the congregation was received in full fellowship in the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1816 Rev Richard Allen brought together other black Methodist congregations from the region to organize the new African Methodist Episcopal Church denomination. He was elected bishop of this denomination. After the American Civil War, its missionaries went to the South to help freedmen and planted many new churches in the region.
Passage 3: Prior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors had met in Philadelphia (Independence Hall and Congress Hall), New York City (Federal Hall), and a number of other locations (York, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland; and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey). In September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.
Passage 4: The state government left Philadelphia in 1799, and the federal government was moved to Washington, DC in 1800 with completion of the White House and Capitol. The city remained the young nation's largest with a population of nearly 50,000 at the turn of the 19th century; it was a financial and cultural center. Before 1800, its free black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first independent black denomination in the country, and the first black Episcopal Church. The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. New York City soon surpassed Philadelphia in population, but with the construction of roads, canals, and railroads, Philadelphia became the first major industrial city in the United States.
Your Response: 
  The question asks who started the Bethel branch of the religion the black community founded in the former U.S. capital.
  Passage 4 states that the African Methodist Episcopal Church was founded by the free black community in Philadelphia, the former U.S. capital.
  Passage 2 states that Mother Bethel was one of the first African-American churches and was dedicated on July 29, 1794, by Bishop Francis Asbury.
  Therefore, the Bethel branch was started by Bishop Francis Asbury.

Question: Where is the lowest place in the country which, along with Eisenhower's VP's country, recognized Gaddafi's government early on?
Passage 1: Yugoslavia had a liberal travel policy permitting foreigners to freely travel through the country and its citizens to travel worldwide, whereas it was limited by most Communist countries. A number[quantify] of Yugoslav citizens worked throughout Western Europe. Tito met many world leaders during his rule, such as Soviet rulers Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev; Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, Indian politicians Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi; British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill, James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher; U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter; other political leaders, dignitaries and heads of state that Tito met at least once in his lifetime included Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Yasser Arafat, Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt, Georges Pompidou, Queen Elizabeth II, Hua Guofeng, Kim Il Sung, Sukarno, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Suharto, Idi Amin, Haile Selassie, Kenneth Kaunda, Gaddafi, Erich Honecker, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r and Urho Kekkonen. He also met numerous celebrities.
Passage 2: After the 1969 coup, representatives of the Four Powers \u2013 France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union \u2013 were called to meet RCC representatives. The U.K. and U.S. quickly extended diplomatic recognition, hoping to secure the position of their military bases in Libya and fearing further instability. Hoping to ingratiate themselves with Gaddafi, in 1970 the U.S. informed him of at least one planned counter-coup. Such attempts to form a working relationship with the RCC failed; Gaddafi was determined to reassert national sovereignty and expunge what he described as foreign colonial and imperialist influences. His administration insisted that the U.S. and U.K. remove their military bases from Libya, with Gaddafi proclaiming that \"the armed forces which rose to express the people's revolution [will not] tolerate living in their shacks while the bases of imperialism exist in Libyan territory.\" The British left in March and the Americans in June 1970.
Your Response: 
  The question asks for the lowest place in the country that, along with the country of Eisenhower’s vice president, recognized Gaddafi’s government.
  Passage 2 shows that Gaddafi’s government was recognized early by the U.S. and the U.K.
  However, none of the passages mention the lowest geographical point in the U.K.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given passages.
