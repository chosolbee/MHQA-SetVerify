He is best known as the founder of the confections company that eventually evolved into Kern's Bakery, a brand still marketed in the Knoxville area. The company's former confectionery and ice cream parlor, now called the Mall Building (or Oliver Hotel), still dominates the southwest corner of Market Square. Kern served as Knoxville's mayor from 1890 until 1892. Kern was born in Zwingenberg (near Heidelberg) in Germany\nIntermediate answer: Peter Kern died in Knoxville, Tennessee."]
